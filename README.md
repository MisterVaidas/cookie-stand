# Awesome Cookie Stand

## Project Description

Awesome Cookie Stand is a website for a fictional cookie stand that sells salmon-flavored cookies. It includes features for customers to learn about the business, order cookies, and view sales data. The website also includes an internal page for viewing and processing customer orders.

## Features

- Display of daily projected sales data for multiple cookie stand locations.
- Form for customers to order cookies and merchandise.
- Page for viewing and processing customer orders.
- Customers can choose among multiple display or color profiles for the page.

### Sales Page

This page presents the projected hourly sales data for each store location in a table format. It also has a link to the order page.

### Order Page (store.html)

This page contains a form where customers can order cookies and swag. The form includes fields for:

- Customer's name and address
- Email address
- Phone number
- Quantity of cookies
- Additional special instructions

### Order Processing Page (order-processing.html)

This private page shows a list of pending orders and their details. The business owner can process the orders by clicking a button next to the order. This action moves the list item to a "Filled Orders" list at the bottom of the page.

### New Cookie Stand Form

This form allows the addition of a new cookie stand. On submission, an event handler creates a new instance of a cookie stand and appends it to the sales data table.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to add more functionality to the site, including:

- An inventory management system.
- Integration with a payment gateway for processing orders.
- Interactive elements for user engagement.
