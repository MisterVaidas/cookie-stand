# Cookie Stand

This project simulates a cookie stand chain which provides hourly sales data for each location on a publicly-facing webpage.

## Overview

The project uses JavaScript object literals to handle the calculation of daily sales at each store. It uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to display these sales on the webpage. The design of the webpage is responsive and accessible, with a focus on clean, readable design.
